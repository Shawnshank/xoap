\section*{Course description}

To create a wireless embedded hardware bridge using \emph{RUST} to read and collect sensory information through a serial protocol and relay the data via CoAP to a server for filtering and displaying of the data. 

\section*{Relevant information}
System that will be used is a \emph{Nucleo-64} with an \emph{STM32F401} ARM microcontroller. \\ 
Some of the crates that might be used are 
\begin{itemize}
\item \href{https://crates.io/crates/coap}{coap}
\item  \href{https://crates.io/crates/smoltcp}{smoltcp}
\item  \href{https://crates.io/crates/cortex-m}{cortex-m}
\end{itemize}
as well as crates and/or code developed by other course participants.
